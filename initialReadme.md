# Starter Repo for Assignment 6

As described in the assignment, each person should be added as a collaborator to this assignment. Because this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), you'll begin by installing your packages and then starting a server:

```bash
# Install packages in your terminal
npm install

# Start running a local server
npm start
```

Each time someone adds a new library, they should add it to the `package.json` file as part of the download process by running the following line of code:


```bash
# Install jquery and track that in package.json
npm install jquery --save
```

Then, when other group members pull in your changes, they'll be able to update their packages by running `npm install` again.

When you are finished, you'll need to build your project (`npm run build`) and deploy it.
